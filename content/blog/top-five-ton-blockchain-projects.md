The [Open Network (TON)](https://ton.org/) has quietly transformed into one of the most promising blockchain ecosystems in the space — with Telegram’s native support acting as a launchpad for mass adoption. Originally conceptualized by the Telegram team and later revived by the open-source community, TON has matured rapidly into a high-throughput, low-cost, and user-friendly blockchain that’s now making headlines for all the right reasons.

As we head into 2025, the momentum behind TON is impossible to ignore. Major integrations with Telegram’s interface, exponential growth in wallet downloads, increasing DeFi activity, and a surge in developer tooling have positioned TON for a breakout year. Its unique combination of scalability, mobile-first accessibility, and tight Telegram integration makes it a prime candidate for onboarding millions of new users into Web3 — many of whom may not even realize they’re using a blockchain.

In this article, we’ll explore the top five TON projects to watch in 2025, based on a few core criteria:
- Adoption potential: How likely is the project to reach and retain real users?
- Technical innovation: Does it solve a hard problem or bring something new to the table?
- TON-native architecture: Is the project truly built for TON, or just ported over?
- Community traction: Are users excited, engaged, and actively contributing?



## What Makes a Project Stand Out on TON?

To stand out on TON, a project must go beyond simply existing on the blockchain — it must embrace what makes TON unique.

First, there’s the importance of being TON-native. This means using Jettons (TON’s token standard), deploying contracts optimized for TON’s architecture, and integrating directly with Telegram’s interface when applicable. Projects that feel like they belong inside the Telegram experience — not just bolted onto it — have a distinct advantage.

Then there’s the technical edge: TON is designed for speed, scalability, and near-zero fees. Projects that optimize for these strengths — such as low-latency trading bots, scalable DeFi protocols, or lightweight NFT platforms — tend to perform better and deliver smoother UX. In a mobile-first world, TON projects that prioritize fast loading, intuitive navigation, and seamless onboarding are best positioned for growth.

Finally, community alignment and real-world use cases play a huge role. Projects that solve real problems (like remittances, trading automation, or digital identity) and attract active user bases tend to build lasting momentum. On TON, where community engagement often happens in Telegram groups or mini-apps, this user feedback loop is even tighter.

With that context in mind, let’s dive into the top five projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on TON in 2025.


### Project #1: STON.fi

[STON.fi](https://ston.fi/) is the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) built specifically for the TON blockchain. As the TON ecosystem grows, STON.fi has emerged as a foundational piece of infrastructure, offering seamless token swaps through an automated market maker (AMM) model.

**Core features:** <br/>
	•	Feeless trading thanks to TON’s negligible gas costs
	•	AMM liquidity pools with growing support for Jettons
	•	Mobile-optimized UI, tightly integrated with Telegram Mini Apps
	•	TON Wallet support including Tonkeeper and Wallet in Telegram

**2025 Outlook:**<br/>
STON.fi is poised to evolve into the anchor liquidity layer on TON. With DeFi interest on the rise and new Jettons launching weekly, we expect STON.fi to deepen its liquidity, roll out DEX aggregator tools, and potentially integrate multichain routing to compete with platforms like 1inch or UniswapX. Its edge in user experience and TON-native infrastructure makes it one to watch closely.


### Project #2: Fragment

[Fragment](https://fragment.com/) is an official marketplace for buying and selling Telegram usernames and digital identities — a unique innovation that blends social reputation with blockchain ownership.

**Strategic edge:**<br/>
	•	Built by the Telegram team itself
	•	Fully integrated with the Telegram app
	•	Focused on digital identity, handles, and collectible assets
	•	Utilizes smart contracts and TON-based payment flows

**2025 Outlook:**<br/>
As Web3 identity becomes more important, Fragment is likely to expand into new asset classes like NFTs, tokenized content, and verifiable credentials. Expect closer ties to Telegram’s mini apps and monetized user experiences. With its first-mover advantage in Telegram’s native asset ecosystem, Fragment could redefine digital identity in Web3.


### Project #3: Tonkeeper


[Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) is the most popular non-custodial wallet on TON — the go-to app for sending, receiving, and managing Jettons and NFTs across the TON ecosystem.

**Core functionality:**<br/>
- Support for Jettons, NFTs, and DApps
- Embedded browser for TON DeFi and games
- Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps
- Clean mobile UI and Telegram compatibility


**2025 Outlook:**<br/>
Tonkeeper is evolving from a wallet into a full-fledged DeFi hub. In 2025, we expect it to support staking, cross-chain bridges, and improved security UX, such as seedless recovery or multi-factor protections. With its strong brand and UX-first approach, Tonkeeper remains central to user onboarding on TON.



### Project #4: TonderLabs

[TonderBot](https://www.tonderlabs.com/bot) built by developers at [Tonderlabs](https://www.tonderlabs.com/) builds TON-native infrastructure for automated crypto trading, focusing on low-latency, cost-efficient bots for market making, arbitrage, and other high-frequency strategies.

**Unique proposition:**<br/>
- Designed exclusively for the TON blockchain
- Utilizes TON’s fast finality and low fees for real-time trades
- Built with a Telegram-first user experience in mind

**2025 Outlook:**<br/>
TonderLabs is set to expand its ecosystem with deeper DEX integrations, community-created strategy pools, and Telegram-integrated dashboards that allow users to run bots directly from chats. As on-chain trading matures on TON, TonderLabs is uniquely positioned to lead that evolution.


7. Project #5: Tonano

[Tonano](https://tonano.io/marketplace) is a decentralized file-sharing and monetization platform built on TON, allowing users to share encrypted files and earn Jettons for downloads or access.

**Why it stands out:**<br/>
- Combines Web3 privacy with TON’s scalability
- Files are encrypted and access-controlled
- Monetization via Jettons (TON-native tokens)
- Use case: artists, educators, and indie developers monetizing directly

**2025 Outlook:**<br/>
Tonano is likely to push deeper into DAO-powered content governance, mobile-native uploads/downloads, and smart access control for things like time-locked files or subscription-based models. Its alignment with TON’s vision of permissionless, decentralized, and user-friendly services makes it a project with long-term potential.

## Other Ton Projects

While our top five highlight the most impactful TON projects to watch in 2025, several other emerging players are worth keeping an eye on:

- [**DeDust**](https://dedust.io/) – A lightweight, TON-native DEX with a focus on simplicity and performance. Still early in its roadmap, but rapidly improving its UI and liquidity support.
- [**TON Punks**](https://getgems.io/collection/EQAo92DYMokxghKcq-CkCGSk_MgXY5Fo1SPW20gkvZl75iCN) – A nostalgic nod to the NFT OGs, this project brings collectible culture to the TON ecosystem. It’s helping bootstrap NFT activity on-chain.
- [**Open Builders**](https://openbuilders.xyz/) – A fast-growing dev collective offering tools, SDKs, and templates for TON dApp developers. Their community-driven model fosters grassroots innovation.

With Telegram’s massive global user base as its backbone, TON-native apps can reach millions with no onboarding friction. Its seamless Mini App integration, near-zero fees, and lightning-fast finality give developers the UX foundation they’ve long craved in Web3.

Add to this an expanding toolset (e.g., TON Connect, Jettons, and secure smart contracts) and a growing stream of institutional interest and community grants, and it’s clear that TON is quickly becoming a hotspot for blockchain innovation—especially for mobile-first and consumer-ready applications

## Wrapping Up

From decentralized exchanges and wallets to identity marketplaces and trading automation, the TON ecosystem in 2025 is rich with diversity and promise. The projects we’ve highlighted—STON.fi, Fragment, Tonkeeper, TonderLabs, and Tonano—showcase the real-world use cases and developer ingenuity flourishing on TON.

As the Web3 space continues to evolve, TON’s unique position within the Telegram ecosystem, combined with its low fees and fast finality, makes it a powerful platform for mainstream blockchain adoption.
