# Test Blog Post with Gradient Fallback

This is a test blog post created to demonstrate the gradient fallback feature when no image is provided in the markdown frontmatter.

## Features Implemented

The blog system now includes:

1. **Markdown File Integration**: Blog posts are read from markdown files in the `/content/blog/` directory
2. **Gradient Fallback**: When no image is specified, a beautiful gradient is used as the default
3. **Read Time Calculation**: Automatic calculation and display of estimated reading time

## How It Works

The system automatically:

- Parses markdown frontmatter for metadata
- Renders markdown content with custom styling
- Calculates reading time based on word count
- Uses gradient as fallback when image is missing

This ensures a consistent and professional appearance across all blog posts, regardless of whether a custom image is provided.

## Next Steps

With these features implemented, the blog system is now fully functional and ready for content creation. The gradient fallback ensures visual consistency while the markdown integration provides flexibility for content authors.
